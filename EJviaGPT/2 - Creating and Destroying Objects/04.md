### Noninstantiable utility class

```java
// Attempting to enforce noninstantiability by making a class abstract does not work.
// A class can be made noninstantiable by including a private constructor.

public class UtilityClass {

    // Suppress default constructor for noninstantiability
    private UtilityClass() {
        // The AssertionError isnâ€™t strictly required, but it provides insurance in case the constructor is accidentally invoked from within the class. 
        throw new AssertionError();
    }

    // Remainder omitted
}

// As a side effect, this idiom also prevents the class from being subclassed. Because all constructors must invoke a superclass constructor, explicitly or implicitly.
```
