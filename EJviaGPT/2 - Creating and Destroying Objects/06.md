## Common

## Main

### Static factory method > constructor

```java
// The constructor must create a new object each time it’s called, while the factory method is never required to do so and won’t in practice.

// you can also reuse mutable objects if you know they won’t be modified

```

```java
//  prefer primitives to boxed primitives, and watch out for unintentional autoboxing

private static long sum() {
    // should be "long sum = 0L"
    Long sum = 0L; 
    for (long i = 0; i <= Integer.MAX_VALUE; i++)
    
    // constructs roughly one Long instance for each time the long i is added to the Long sum
    sum += i; 
    return sum;
}
```
