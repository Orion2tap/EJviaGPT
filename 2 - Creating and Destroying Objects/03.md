## Common

## Main

### 1. Public field approach

```java
// Pros: Suitable for cases where a singleton is needed throughout the entire runtime of the program. Thread-safe.
// Cons: Creates the instance during class loading, unable to achieve lazy instantiation (延迟实例化 / 延迟加载), may consume memory prematurely and increase program startup time.

public class Elvis {
    // The private constructor is called only once, to initialize the public static final field Elvis.INSTANCE.
    // A 'static' member variable is initialized when the class is loaded, not when an object is instantiated. This means that no matter how many instances of the class are created, they will all share the same 'INSTANCE'.
    public static final Elvis INSTANCE = new Elvis();

    // a privileged (特许的) client can invoke the private constructor reflectively (Item 65) with the aid of the AccessibleObject.setAccessible method. 
    // If you need to defend against this attack, modify the constructor to make it throw an exception if it’s asked to create a second instance.
    private Elvis() {...}

    public void leaveTheBuilding() {...}
}
```

```java
// call
Elvis.INSTANCE
```

### 2. Static factory approach (Eager Initialization)

```java
// Pros: Flexible control logic can be implemented within the static factory method.
// Cons: The instance is created during class loading, making lazy instantiation impossible.

public class Elvis {
    // the private static field is final, so it will always contain the same object reference.
    private static final Elvis INSTANCE = new Elvis();

    private Elvis() { ... }

    public static Elvis getInstance() { 
        return INSTANCE; 
    }

    public void leaveTheBuilding() { ... }
}
```

```java
// call
Elvis.getInstance();
```

### Lazy Initialization

```java
// Pros: The instance is created only when first used, saving memory.
// Cons: Multiple threads may create multiple instances at the same time, making it thread-unsafe.

public class SingletonLazy {
    // The initial value is null.
    private static SingletonLazy instance;

    private SingletonLazy() {}

    public static SingletonLazy getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new SingletonLazy();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}

```

### Double-Checked Locking

```java
// Pros: Ensures both thread safety and lazy instantiation at the same time.

public class Elvis {
    // "volatile" prevents instruction reordering.
    private static volatile Elvis instance;

    private Elvis() { ... }

    public static Elvis getInstance() {
        // First check: If the instance is null, proceed to the next step.
        if (instance == null) {
            // Acquire the lock to ensure only one thread can enter the synchronized block.
            synchronized (Elvis.class) {
                // Second check: Because after the first check, another thread may have created the instance.
                if (instance == null) {
                    // Create the instance.
                    instance = new Elvis();
                }
            }
        }
        // Return the created instance.
        return instance;
    }

    public void leaveTheBuilding() { ... }
}

```

### Static factory approach - Pro 1

```java
// One advantage of the static factory approach is that it gives you the flexibility to change your mind about whether the class is a singleton without changing its API. The factory method returns the sole instance, but it could be modified to return a separate instance for each thread that invokes it.

public class ThreadSpecificSingleton {
    private static final ThreadLocal<ThreadSpecificSingleton> instances = ThreadLocal.withInitial(ThreadSpecificSingleton::new);

    private ThreadSpecificSingleton() {}

    public static ThreadSpecificSingleton getInstance() {
        return instances.get();
    }
}

// In this modified example, ThreadSpecificSingleton uses a ThreadLocal to create a separate instance for each thread that invokes the getInstance method. This way, each thread has its own unique instance of ThreadSpecificSingleton.

// The method call sequence in this code is as follows:

// 1. The getInstance() method is called.
// 2. getInstance() invokes the get() method of the ThreadLocal object named instances.
// 3. If this is the first time the method is called in a thread, ThreadLocal.withInitial() is used to create a new instance of ThreadSpecificSingleton for the current thread.
// 4. The created instance is stored in a map associated with the current thread, making it specific to that thread.
// 5. The instance specific to the current thread is returned by get().

// This ensures that each thread gets its own unique instance of ThreadSpecificSingleton.
```

### Static factory approach - Pro 2

```java
// A second advantage is that you can write a generic singleton factory if your application requires it (Item 30).

public class SingletonFactory<T> {
    // Supplier<T> is a functional interface in the Java standard library. It defines an abstract method named 'get' that takes no arguments but returns an object of type T, used to supply an object.
    private final Supplier<T> supplier;
    private T instance;

    private SingletonFactory(Supplier<T> supplier) {
        this.supplier = supplier;
    }

    // 'of' is often used to indicate the "creation" action.
    public static <T> SingletonFactory<T> of(Supplier<T> supplier) {
        return new SingletonFactory<>(supplier);
    }

    public T getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized (this) {
                if (instance == null) {
                    // When supplier.get() is called, it executes "() -> "Hello World"" and returns the string "Hello World".
                    instance = supplier.get();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}

```

```java
// call

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // () -> "Hello World"
        // this specific lambda expression doesn't take any arguments but returns the string "Hello World". Therefore, it conforms to the definition of the Supplier<String> interface and can be used as a parameter.
        SingletonFactory<String> stringFactory = SingletonFactory.of(() -> "Hello World");
        String instance1 = stringFactory.getInstance();
        String instance2 = stringFactory.getInstance();

        System.out.println(instance1 == instance2); // Output: true, both references point to the same instance
        System.out.println(instance1); // Output: Hello World

    }
}

```

### Static factory approach - Pro 3

```java
// A final advantage of using a static factory is that a method reference can be used as a supplier, for example Elvis::instance is a Supplier<Elvis>. 

import java.util.function.Supplier;

public class Elvis {
    private static final Elvis INSTANCE = new Elvis();

    private Elvis() { }

    public static Elvis getInstance() { return INSTANCE; }

    public void leaveTheBuilding() {
        System.out.println("Elvis has left the building.");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a Supplier named elvisSupplier that refers to the getInstance method.
        Supplier<Elvis> elvisSupplier = Elvis::getInstance;
        // it effectively calls Elvis.getInstance(), which returns the single instance of Elvis.
        Elvis elvisInstance = elvisSupplier.get();
        // We can then perform operations on this instance, such as calling leaveTheBuilding().
        elvisInstance.leaveTheBuilding();
    }
}

```

### Summary

```java
// Unless one of these advantages is relevant, the public field approach is preferable.

// To make a singleton class that uses either of these approaches serializable (Chapter 12), it is not sufficient merely to add implements Serializable to its declaration.

// To maintain the singleton guarantee, declare all instance fields transient and provide a readResolve method (Item 89). Otherwise, each time a serialized instance is deserialized, a new instance will be created.

```

### 3. Single-element enum approach

```java
// A single-element enum type is often the best way to implement a singleton. It provides a simple and thread-safe way to implement a singleton, while also ensuring that new instances are not created through deserialization.
// Note that you can’t use this approach if your singleton must extend a superclass

public enum SingletonEnum {
    INSTANCE;

    // Other fields and methods in the enum class can be used just like in a regular class. 
    private String someData;

    SingletonEnum() {
        someData = "Hello, I am the singleton enum!";
    }

    public String getSomeData() {
        return someData;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SingletonEnum singleton = SingletonEnum.INSTANCE;
        System.out.println(singleton.getSomeData());
    }
}

```
