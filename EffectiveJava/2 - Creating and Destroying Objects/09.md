### try-finally

```java
static String firstLineOfFile(String path) throws IOException {
    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(path));
    try {
        // the call to readLine could throw an exception due to a failure in the underlying physical device
        return br.readLine();
    } finally {
        // and the call to close could then fail for the same reason
        br.close();
    }
}

// The second exception completely obliterates the first one. There is no record of the first exception in the exception stack trace, which can greatly complicate debugging in real systems
```

### try-with-sources

```java
// To be usable with this construct, a resource must implement the AutoCloseable interface

static String firstLineOfFile(String path) throws IOException {
    //  If exceptions are thrown by both the readLine call and the (invisible) close, the latter exception is suppressed in favor of the former.
    try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(path))) {
        return br.readLine();
    }
}

//  These suppressed exceptions are not merely discarded; they are printed in the stack trace with a notation saying that they were suppressed. You can also access them programmatically with the getSuppressed method, which was added to Throwable in Java 7.
```
